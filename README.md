# About my Pine City Zoo project
# This is a sample website of a zoo
# The home page is the landing page, which has also been linked to the 'Map' tab and is a map of the whole park
# When you click on the 'Animals' tab, it will direct you to all the listed animals present at the zoo, with fun facts, as well as where that specific animal can be found within the zoo.
# The 'Places' tab will direct you to all the places you can visit within the zoo, such as eating spots, coffee shops, and places visitors can visit for fun.
# The 'Weather' tab has been provided so that visitors can see the forecasted weather for the day(s) they plan to visit our zoo.
# The 'Feedback' tab serves as a survey for visitors to share their experiences with us.
